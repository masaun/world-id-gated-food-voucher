  - World ID-based verification that is used in this smart contract might be a good alternative verification solution instead of the way based on [biometric verification](https://medium.com/world-food-programme-insight/the-full-circuit-how-wfp-is-enabling-biometric-verification-in-uganda-823da0bf6ba7).

- Remarks:
  - `World ID` is a protocol that lets you prove a human is doing an action only once without revealing any personal data. Stop bots, stop abuse.
    - World ID uses a device called the `Orb` which takes a picture of a person's iris to verify they are a unique and alive human. The protocol uses `Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)` so no traceable information is ever public.  
    - World ID is meant for on-chain web3 apps, traditional cloud applications, and even IRL verifications.
